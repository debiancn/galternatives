G Alternatives is a tool that provides a simple GUI interface for `update-alternatives`, allowing system administrator to select which programs provide specific services for the user by default. Some advanced features are also provided, including adding/removing/editing alternative groups/options or managing a custom database directory.

The program is provided as Python 2/3 compatible, but we prefer Python 3 and support for Python 2 is not well-tested. It's intended to be installed via `apt`, but for those who don't like to install, downloading and extracting the tarball should also works.

Any question or enhancement is welcomed. Send your issue/pr to GitHub.
